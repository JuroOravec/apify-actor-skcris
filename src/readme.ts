### Comments on performance

The speed of scraping depends on:

1. Detailed vs fast mode:
    - In fast mode, we only request the HTML (web page). This is much faster.
    - In detailed mode, we make 10-20+ more requests against the server, and
    the server has to look up items in the database for each request. Hence it's slower.

2. Server load
    - If there is no load on the server, we can do more requests to get the results faster.
    - But if there is already considerable load (e.g. someone else is scraping too),
    then expect a slower response.

> **To ensure you get the data, you should configure the crawler settings to minimize timeout errors**

Recommended settings:

- **maxConcurrency** - Up to 8. However, if you keep getting timeour errors, the server
  might be under heavier load, in which case set maxConcurrency to 3.
- **Memory (RAM)** - 512 MB (there's no point in going higher), or 256 MB if maxConcurrency is set to 3.
- **Timeout** - No timeout.`,

    limitBeforeEnd: `Best practice:

- Keep \`listingFilterMaxCount\` no higher than 500. Increasing \`listingFilterMaxCount\`
increases 1) the chance of the requests failing and 2) memory requirements.

- Set \`listingFilterMaxCount\` to a multiple of \`listingItemsPerPage\`. Otherwise,
  you will get more results than you wanted.

    Example: If I want 800 results, I set \`listingFilterMaxCount\` to 800,
    and \`listingItemsPerPage\` to 400.`,
