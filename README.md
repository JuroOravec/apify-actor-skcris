## Checklist

1. Dataset identification

    - [ ] 1.1 Identify distinct types of web pages and the data of interest

    - [ ] 1.3 Define labels for these distinct types in `./router.ts`
    - [ ] 1.4 Define default handler matchers based on these distinct types in `./router.ts`

3. Entry scheduling / Listing

    - [ ] 2.0 How do I find the listing page(s), is it single or more pages? (remember how paperindex was structured)
    - [ ] 2.1 Check if you need browser / JS to make the listing load
    - [ ] 2.2 Check if you need to click / trigger anything to make the listing load
    - [ ] 2.3 Check if you need cookie session to make the listing load
    - [ ] 2.4 Check if you need to be logged in to make the listing load
    - [ ] 2.5 Check if the page differs if you visit it via incognito
    - [ ] 2.6 How do I find the total results count?
    - [ ] 2.7 Check if there's upper limit on the listing results
      - [ ] 2.7.1 If so, what strategies are available to get over the limit?
    - [ ] 2.8 What filters are available?
      - [ ] 2.8.1 Are the filters set via query params, post body, interaction with server, or other?
      - [ ] 2.8.2 Identify the available / permitted values for each of filters?
    - [ ] 2.9 Is there option to set items per page and / or current page?
      - [ ] 2.9.1 If available, to how high value can I set items per page? Does it impact load time?
    - [ ] 2.10 How do I reset the filter? Do I need to interact with the server (like in SKSCRIS?)
    - [ ] 2.11 Is there other data on the entries that's on the listing page, but not on entry page?
    - [ ] 2.12 Is the data on listing page sufficient for a "simple" version of the dataset?
    - [ ] 2.13 Are there non-entry elements in the list? (E.g. inline ads) How do I exclude them?
